            <h1>Role of Franchasi</h1>
            <p>This year marks an exciting new chapter for SG PANI PURI as we embark on our journey to expand our
                brand through a franchise model. Founded with the vision of building a strong presence in the food
                industry, this model offers a unique opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs to join hands with us
                and become part of our growing family. By franchising, we aim to not only extend the reach of our
                beloved Pani Puri but also to empower others with the tools and support needed to run a successful
                business. Together, we can bring the authentic taste of our street food to more communities,
                creating a network of passionate business owners dedicated to maintaining the quality and tradition
                that SG PANI PURI is known for

                <br>

                franchise partners. As one of the fastest-growing street food chains, we are excited to expand our
                reach through new franchise partnerships. Join us on this journey, and let's grow togetherâ€”not just
